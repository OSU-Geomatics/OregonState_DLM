	\subsection*{Overview}
	
	Testing the GUI interface requires a data stream over two COM ports with the data from the Teensy microcontrollers.  Rather than always needing to be physically connected to the hardware, a virtual COM port is created which simulates the data stream from the sensors at the correct baud rate.  This allows the GUI to be tested and developed in a less cumbersome manner.
